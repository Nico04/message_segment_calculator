# SMS Segment Calculator

The SMS Segment Calculator is a Dart package designed to help developers accurately calculate the number of SMS segments required for messages. It supports both GSM-7 and UCS-2 encoding standards, providing a robust solution for applications that involve SMS messaging. The package ensures cost-effective messaging by optimizing message segmentation and encoding.

## Key Features

- **Accurate SMS Segmentation**: Automatically calculates the number of segments needed for a given SMS message based on its content and required encoding (GSM-7 or UCS-2).
- **Support for Special Characters and Emojis**: Detects texts containing emojis or special characters and switches to UCS-2 encoding when necessary.
- **Comprehensive Encoding Management**: Handles the encoding of individual characters and manages their conversion to the appropriate encoding format.
- **Cost Management**: Provides precise segment counts for budgeting and planning SMS costs effectively.
- **Line Break Handling**: Identifies different line break styles and issues warnings if incompatible styles are detected.

## Installation

To integrate the SMS Segment Calculator into your Dart or Flutter project, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  sms_segment_calculator: ^0.1.0



## Usage

import 'package:sms_segment_calculator/sms_segment_calculator.dart';

void main() {
  String message = '''Hi Roberta,
It's Peter with Krown Funding touching base.
It's not too late to get funded before the weekend ðŸ¤‘.
Reply Yes to Get Funded Today or DND to opt-out.''';

  // Initialize the SegmentedMessage class to calculate SMS segments.
  SegmentedMessage segmentedMessage = SegmentedMessage(message);

  // Output various properties of the segmented message.
  print("Total Size in Bits: ${segmentedMessage.totalSize}");
  print("Message Size in Bits: ${segmentedMessage.messageSize}");
  print("Segments Count: ${segmentedMessage.segmentsCount}");
  print("Number of Characters: ${segmentedMessage.numberOfCharacters}");
  print("Number of Unicode Scalars: ${segmentedMessage.numberOfUnicodeScalars}");
}
